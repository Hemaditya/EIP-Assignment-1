### Convolutions
Convolution is the process of applying a kernel to an image to extract the features from the image.

### Filters/Kernels
These are feature extractors which are convolved over images and extract features from the image.

### Epochs
Epoch is the number of iterations over the entire dataset along with forward and  backward pass that is done.

### Feature Maps
Feature Maps are learned kernels

### Activation Function
Functions which give non linearity to the neural networks. Sigmoid squishes the values between 0,1

### Receptive Field
Receptive field the area of the image that the kernel sees
